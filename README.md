# `issues.app`, an issue tracker

This repository holds the beginnings of what will hopefully become a fully-fledged issue tracker, written with Flask and Pytest. 

Through working on this project, my goal is to learn software development best-practices and improve my skills in application design. More information about the project can be found [here](https://www.remotelycurious.net/post/issues-app-01-intro/).
